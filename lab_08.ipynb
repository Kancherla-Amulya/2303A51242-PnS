        "A housing survey in Hanamkonda suggests that the average monthly rent for a standard room is claimed to be ₹10,000. The local real estate agency wants to verify this claim and determine whether the average room rent is significantly different from ₹10,000. A sample of room rents from 17 different locations in Hanamkonda has been collected as [8800, 10000, 7000, 9900, 9950, 8200, 10100, 9000, 9700, 10800, 10000, 10250, 10300, 9900, 4000, 6000, 6500] You are tasked with testing the hypothesis regarding the average rent price. Your tasks include:\n",
